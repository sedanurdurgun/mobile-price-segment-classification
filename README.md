# Mobile Price Segment Classification

This project was developed as a 4th-year design course assignment.

The objective of the project is to classify mobile phones into price segments (Low, Mid, High) using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains technical specifications such as RAM, storage, processor details, battery capacity, camera features, ratings, and overall specs score.

The project covers the full machine learning pipeline, including data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and interpretability.

## Key Components
- Data preprocessing and smart missing value handling
- Extensive exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Feature extraction using custom transformers
- Machine learning pipelines with multiple classifiers
- Model comparison and performance evaluation
- Confusion matrix, F1-score, and calibration analysis
- Feature importance and model interpretability (SHAP)
- Post-analysis to identify potential price/performance opportunities

## Models Used
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gradient Boosting

## Purpose
This project is intended for academic and educational purposes and focuses on demonstrating analytical thinking, feature engineering, and model evaluation rather than production deployment.

Further improvements are planned, including dataset expansion, model optimization, and advanced interpretability analysis.
